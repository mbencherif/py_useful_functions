    Open the /etc/fstab file using any text editor, such as nano or vim.

    [ec2-user ~]$ sudo vim /etc/fstab
      Add the following entry to /etc/fstab to mount the device at the specified mount point. The fields are the UUID value returned by blkid (or lsblk for Ubuntu 18.04), the mount point, the file system, and the recommended file system mount options. For more information about the required fields, run man fstab to open the fstab manual.
      In the following example, we mount the device with UUID aebf131c-6957-451e-8d34-ec978d9581ae to mount point /data and we use the xfs file system. We also use the defaults and nofail flags. We specify 0 to prevent the file system from being dumped, and we specify 2 to indicate that it is a non-root device.
      UUID=aebf131c-6957-451e-8d34-ec978d9581ae  /data  xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2
    Note
    If you ever boot your instance without this volume attached (for example, after moving the volume to another instance), the nofail mount option enables the instance to boot even if there are errors mounting the volume. Debian derivatives, including Ubuntu versions earlier than 16.04, must also add the nobootwait mount option.
    To verify that your entry works, run the following commands to unmount the device and then mount all file systems in /etc/fstab. If there are no errors, the /etc/fstab file is OK and your file system will mount automatically after it is rebooted.
    [ec2-user ~]$ sudo umount /data
    [ec2-user ~]$ sudo mount -a
